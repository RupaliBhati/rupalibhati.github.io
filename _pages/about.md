My research interests are reinforcement learning, machine learning and deep learning. I am an experienced independent researcher with a penchant for teaching.

I worked as a Research Assitant at Indraprastha Institute of Technology under the guidance of [Dr. Saket Anand](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/anands). I completed my B.Tech from Delhi Technological University with a major in Electronics and Communication in 2016, where [Dr. S.Indu](http://dtu.irins.org/profile/66967#other_information_panel) was my mentor.
