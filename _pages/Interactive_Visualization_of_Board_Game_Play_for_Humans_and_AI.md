### Motivation

Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are now achieving superhuman performance in many games. The strategies developed by such agents can be used to help human players improve their strategies. Moreover, interactive visualisation tools can help users understand complex AI strategies.
To support this, we designed a recommendation-based visualization tool that board-game players and researchers can use while they are playing the game. The tool highlights both AI-generated and human strategies, where the AI-generated strategy is a pre-trained algorithm, while the human strategy is the most probable human move based on the collected data. Visualising both the AI agent and human strategies on the same board makes it easier for the user to understand and compare how different players—human or artificial—approach the game. We demonstrate the tool using Tic-Tac-Toe, a simple and highly interpretable setting that allows users to clearly see how the recommendations work.
