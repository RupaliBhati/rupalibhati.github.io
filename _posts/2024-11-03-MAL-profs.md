excerpt: "Multi-Agent Learning, Professors"

##### Hey folk! Seeing how helpful my previous blog about professors working in reinforcement learning [link](https://rupalibhati.github.io/RL-profs/) was for everyone, I decided to write another blog on professors working in multi-agent learning (MAL). Since grad school applications are due soon, I hope this is useful for all the aspiring students interested in doing research in MAL.

##### Note: The list is in random order. There are many more professors working in MARL. To find more researchers working in MAL, you may refer to the [MAL Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/berkeleymarl/home).
