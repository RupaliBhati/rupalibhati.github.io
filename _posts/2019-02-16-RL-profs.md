excerpt: "Reinforcement Learning, Professors"

When I started looking for prospective gradschools, my first go-to website to find schools was [csrankings.org](http://csrankings.org). Reinforcement Learning is a field at the intersections of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence so I had to manually check out webpages of the professors listed on csrankings. I would check their publications and try to find work done in reinforcement learning. I have compiled a list of professors working in reinforcement learning and I hope that it would help postgrad aspirants like myself.
