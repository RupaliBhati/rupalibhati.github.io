I am a second year Computer Science M.Sc. student at Université Laval working with <a href="https://audurand.wordpress.com/">Dr. Audrey Durand.
My research interests are reinforcement learning, machine learning and deep learning. I am an experienced independent researcher with a penchant for teaching. <br />
<br />
I will be joining the M.Sc. in Computer Science program at Université Laval in Summer 2020. I'm very excited to work with my research advisor <a href="https://audurand.wordpress.com/">Dr. Audrey Durand.</a>.
<br />
In the past, I have worked as a Research Assitant at Indraprastha Institute of Technology under the guidance of <a href="https://www.iiitd.ac.in/anands">Dr. Saket Anand</a>. I completed my B.Tech from Delhi Technological University with a major in Electronics and Communication in 2016, where <a href="http://dtu.irins.org/profile/66967#other_information_panel">Dr. S.Indu</a> was my mentor. <br />
