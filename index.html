Hi there! :wave:
<br />
<br />
I'm Rupali. I'm in my final year of the M.Sc. in Computer Science program at Universit√© Laval 
and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila, Montreal.</a> 
I'm very fortunate to be working with <a href="https://audurand.wordpress.com/">Audrey Durand.</a> 
I apply interpretable Machine Learning algorithms to problems in healthcare. 
I have also recently started working on problems in Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning.
<br />
<br />
Previously, I worked as a Reinforcement Learning Consultant 
and worked on several cool projects with many startups. 
I also did some work on autonomous vehicles as a 
Research Assistant at Indraprastha Institute of Technology Delhi
with <a href="https://www.iiitd.ac.in/anands"> Saket Anand</a>. 
I completed my B.Tech from Delhi Technological University with a major in Electronics and 
Communication in 2016, where 
<a href="http://dtu.irins.org/profile/66967#other_information_panel">S.Indu</a> was my mentor. <br />
