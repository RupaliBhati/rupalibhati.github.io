I am a second year Computer Science M.Sc. student at Université Laval working with 
<a href="https://audurand.wordpress.com/">Audrey Durand.</a> 
<br />
My research interests are reinforcement learning, machine learning and deep learning. I am an experienced 
independent researcher with a penchant for teaching. <br />
<br />
In the past, I have worked as a Research Assitant at Indraprastha Institute of Technology 
with <a href="https://www.iiitd.ac.in/anands"> Saket Anand</a>. 
I completed my B.Tech from Delhi Technological University with a major in Electronics and 
Communication in 2016, where 
<a href="http://dtu.irins.org/profile/66967#other_information_panel">S.Indu</a> was my mentor. <br />
